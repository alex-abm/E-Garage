# E-Garage

This project involved designing and developing a multi-page website that adheres to industry standards, accessibility guidelines, and best practices. Following 56 detailed success criteria, the website includes at least four interconnected pages (Home, Form, Gallery, etc.), with `index.html` as the homepage. The layout is responsive, featuring at least three breakpoints for optimal viewing across different devices. Semantic HTML5 tags were used to structure content meaningfully, ensuring readability and accessibility. The site incorporates at least five images, a background image, and a video with a preview thumbnail. Interactive elements include a functional form with various input fields, radio buttons, a checkbox, and a textarea, as well as a JavaScript feature to enhance user experience. Accessibility best practices were prioritized, including ALT text for images, clear color contrast, an alternative high-contrast style, and descriptive link texts. Navigation remains consistent across all pages, with visited links clearly distinguishable. The website was thoroughly tested for W3C HTML validation, cross-browser compatibility, and broken links. Course requirements were met and exceeded by implementing mandatory elements such as background images, JavaScript functionality, and semantic HTML5 structure. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development, accessibility compliance, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills in creating a user-friendly and technically sound web experience.
